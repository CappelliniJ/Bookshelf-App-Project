BookApp

This is a bookapp project, that simulates a real website. The website offers a collection of 140 plus books, in different subjects and all in the English language. There are five main links on the website, which include: Home,Books,About,Contact and my very favorite Dedidication! It also has a function to add books and comments. There is a remove button for the comments that does remove them, while on the page, but since I added a feature to keep comments persistant through refresh and changing links, it dosen't work and it also persists :)
