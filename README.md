BookApp

This is a Bookapp project,that simulates a real website, that offers a collection of over 140 books in different categories, all in the English language. The website has four main links: Home, Books, About, and Contact. The website also has a function that allows you to add books, and also add comments to books that are already populated or books you have populated yourself.
